Before looking at the mechanics document, take a look at the Issues page and pick something to do. There is plenty to be done!

Take a look at our mechanics document and add that mechanic to the game. Any bugs and or mechanics you can't figure out, make an issue so others can see what needs to be fixed/worked on

Whenever you work on the project, please make sure to create your own branch from main/master and add to your branch. Unity project file deletion is very frustrating to deal with.
